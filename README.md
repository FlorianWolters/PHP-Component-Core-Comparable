**FlorianWolters\Component\Core\Comparable** is a simple-to-use [PHP][17] component that imposes a total ordering on objects.

## Introduction

This component is inspired by the following three artifacts of the [Java][26] programming language.

* The interface [`java.lang.Comparable`][28] of the [Java][26] Platform Standard Edition (SE).
* The interface [`java.util.Comparator`][29] of the [Java][26] Platform SE.
* The method [`org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils.compare`][30] of the [Apache Commons Lang API][27]:

**FlorianWolters\Component\Core\Comparable** consists of two artifacts:

1. The interface [`FlorianWolters\Component\Core\ComparableInterface`][31]: Imposes a *total ordering* on the objects of each class that implements it.
2. The static class [`FlorianWolters\Component\Core\ComparableUtils`][32]: Offers comparison operations that impose a *total ordering* on objects.

## Features

* The static method `FlorianWolters\Component\Core\ComparableUtils::compare` is `null`-safe. A client can determine if `null` is considered greater than a non-`null` value or if `null` is considered less than a non-`null` value.
* Artifacts tested with both static and dynamic test procedures:
    * Dynamic component tests (unit tests) implemented using [PHPUnit][19].
    * Static code analysis performed using the following tools:
        * [PHP_CodeSniffer][14]: Style Checker
        * [PHP Mess Detector (PHPMD)][18]: Code Analyzer
        * [phpcpd][4]: Copy/Paste Detector (CPD)
        * [phpdcd][5]: Dead Code Detector (DCD)
* Installable via [Composer][3] or the [PEAR command line installer][11]:
    * Provides a [Packagist][25] package which can be installed using the dependency manager [Composer][3].

      Click [here][24] for the package on [Packagist][25].
    * Provides a [PEAR package][13] which can be installed using the package manager [PEAR installer][11].

      Click [here][9] for the [PEAR channel][12].
* Provides a complete Application Programming Interface (API) documentation generated with the documentation generator [ApiGen][2].

  Click [here][1] for the current API documentation.
* Follows the [PSR-0][6] requirements for autoloader interoperability.
* Follows the [PSR-1][7] basic coding style guide.
* Follows the [PSR-2][8] coding style guide.
* Follows the [Semantic Versioning][20] Specification (SemVer) 2.0.0-rc.1.

## Requirements

* [PHP][17] >= 5.4

## Usage

The best documentation for **FlorianWolters\Component\Core\Comparable** are the unit tests, which are shipped in the package. You will find them installed into your [PEAR][10] repository, which on Linux systems is normally `/usr/share/php/test`.

## Installation

### Local Installation

**FlorianWolters\Component\Core\Comparable** should be installed using the dependency manager [Composer][3]. [Composer][3] can be installed with [PHP][6].

    php -r "eval('?>'.file_get_contents('http://getcomposer.org/installer'));"

> This will just check a few [PHP][17] settings and then download `composer.phar` to your working directory. This file is the [Composer][3] binary. It is a PHAR ([PHP][17] archive), which is an archive format for [PHP][17] which can be run on the command line, amongst other things.
>
> Next, run the `install` command to resolve and download dependencies:

    php composer.phar install

### System-Wide Installation

**FlorianWolters\Component\Core\Comparable** should be installed using the [PEAR installer][11]. This installer is the [PHP][17] community's de-facto standard for installing [PHP][17] components.

    pear channel-discover pear.florianwolters.de
    pear install --alldeps fw/Comparable

## As A Dependency On Your Component

### Composer

If you are creating a component that relies on **FlorianWolters\Component\Core\Comparable**, please make sure that you add **FlorianWolters\Component\Core\Comparable** to your component's `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "florianwolters/component-core-comparable": "0.2.*"
    }
}
```

### PEAR

If you are creating a component that relies on **FlorianWolters\Component\Core\Comparable**, please make sure that you add **FlorianWolters\Component\Core\Comparable** to your component's `package.xml` file:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <required>
    <package>
      <name>Comparable</name>
      <channel>pear.florianwolters.de</channel>
      <min>0.2.0</min>
      <max>0.2.99</max>
    </package>
  </required>
</dependencies>
```

## Development Environment

If you want to patch or enhance this component, you will need to create a suitable development environment. The easiest way to do that is to install [phix4componentdev][16]:

    # phix4componentdev
    pear channel-discover pear.phix-project.org
    pear install phix/phix4componentdev

You can then clone the Git repository:

    # PHP-Component-Core-Comparable
    git clone http://github.com/FlorianWolters/PHP-Component-Core-Comparable

Then, install a local copy of this component's dependencies to complete the development environment:

    # build vendor/ folder
    phing build-vendor

To make life easier for you, common tasks (such as running unit tests, generating code review analytics, and creating the [PEAR package][13]) have been automated using [phing][15]. You'll find the automated steps inside the `build.xml` file that ships with the component.

Run the command `phing` in the component's top-level folder to see the full list of available automated tasks.
